# Snaky

Snaky is a small Discord bot that I code on my spare time.
This bot is aimed at allowing users to create themselves custom commands, especially emotes, as well as some other few things.

# A little history of Snaky

> Snaky was created in november 2017 as a bot for my friends' discord server.
At first, it didn't have much success, but with some time and new commands, it started getting some use.
