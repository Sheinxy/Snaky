# Snaky
Small Discord Emote Snake Bot (Amateur Project)

# A little history of Snaky
>Snaky was create in november 2017 as a discord bot for my friends'server.
But, it didn't have a lot of uses, until I added the command Rule34 (wait, this is weird to say, IT STARTED AS A BET OKAY, I'M NOT PROUD OF THIS ! ;-;),
this command was the first real useful command this bot ever had.
Then I started adding a few "Emotes" commands, and that was the time when Snaky got a bit of interest from my friends (JUST A LITTLE BIT).
Furthermore, as the bot improved over time, its icon also did the same thing, going from a totally failed drawing to a pretty nice Salandit, to an actually original Icon ^^
Now, I'm actually looking to improve the bot as much as I can, especially by adding new Commands (Please, don't be afraid to suggest any command ^^)
